/* Our theme was Social Media.
This is first noticed with the color scheme and alternating box styles on the home page. 
The alternating blue and white boxes representing text chat boxes like you would see on a social media site.
The problems on the home page include the empty prep/reading/lab boxes. 
We tried to account for this with empty: commands for every box; however, there is white space in the html and the code could not read the html white space.
We liked the clean look of putting the dates right outside the boxes and keeping the font in an easily readable style.

/*simple very light beige background that makes the other colors on the page pop more and give a relaxing background an app on social media would have as not to draw attention away from other details  */

/*ln16 This displays a very simple sound icon that reads out the person's name */

/*ln28 The day boxes are color-coded to resemble a text or social media conversation */

/*ln324 This navigation bar was styled to look like a social media menu. The icons are background images that are each placed directly
behind the links to each page. The links are covering the images so when you click on an icon, you are really clicking an invisible
link on top of the background image. */

/*ln338 Just resized the image to make it look better.*/

/*ln347 The username was adjusted so it was directly beside the image of the person and the border of the username is a lighter shade of the 
blue used for the text boxes as to fit with the theme of the page. */

/*ln357 This was to organize the table in order to more easily follow where each item was.  */

/*ln382 This makes each navigation link completely clear as to make the illusion that you are clicking on the icon as the link when 
you are actually clicking on these invisible links. */

/*ln419 This makes the Centre logo in the top right corner a background image that pops on each page making it a Centre-themed social media
page. */

/*ln431 This makes the entire body zoom in as if it were sent as a message on social media or a text. It is very quick and not distracting. 
It makes for an asthetically pleasing animation adding to our social media theme. */

/*ln440 This adds the speaker icon to each person's picture on the classmates page. */

/*ln453 This makes it so when you hover over your name, it lights up red, giving a fun little animation that could be present in many 
social media pages, tying to our theme once again. */
